We need the Grunt command line tool, as well as Bower, to get up and running. Make sure you have      Node  installed, then:
 
```
 npm install -g grunt-cli
 npm install -g bower
```

Once those are both installed, we need to install the projectâ€™s dependencies:
 
```
 npm install
 bower install
```

#### Start the server:
 
 * `grunt server`

#### Switch to:

localhost:8000
